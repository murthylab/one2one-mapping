## KO Simulations
To test knockout training with a toy problem (two-layer linear network), check out ```/code/extfig2_KO_simulations```.  This contains Python notebooks that can be run in Google colab. We show that knockout training can successfully recover the ground truth changes in behavior as well as ground truth responses!
